# Revisionist - Game Design Document

## Game Concept

**Revisionist** is a dynamic text-based game where players send SMS-length messages to any historical figure in an attempt to achieve an AI-generated objective. Multiple AI systems work together to simulate historical responses, generate evolving objectives, judge outcomes, and dynamically rewrite the timeline based on player actions.

## Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Overarching Objective**: Receive a grand historical goal generated by AI (e.g., "Prevent World War I" or "Accelerate the Industrial Revolution")
2. **Strategic Planning**: Choose up to 5 historical figures across any time periods to contact
3. **Cross-Timeline Communication**: Send 1 message (160 characters) to each chosen figure
4. **Probabilistic Outcomes**: Each message triggers a dice-based outcome system that adds unpredictability
5. **Timeline Evolution**: Watch how each interaction ripples through history toward your ultimate goal
6. **Final Evaluation**: AI assesses whether your multi-figure strategy successfully achieved the objective

## Game Rules

### Message Constraints
- **Character Limit**: 160 characters per message (standard SMS length)
- **Message Allocation**: 5 total messages that can be distributed across multiple historical figures
- **Strategic Choice**: Contact 1-5 different people (e.g., 5 messages to one person, or 1 message each to 5 different figures)
- **Cross-Timeline Freedom**: Figures can be from completely different eras and locations
- **Creative Communication**: Any message content is valid - even seemingly nonsensical messages can trigger unexpected changes

### Probabilistic Outcome System
- **D20 Dice Mechanics**: Each message triggers a 20-sided die roll to determine outcome magnitude
  - **1-2**: Catastrophic disaster (message creates major unintended consequences that actively harm your objective)
  - **3-7**: Negative outcome (message backfires or creates minor setbacks)
  - **8-13**: Neutral outcome (minimal impact, figure is unmoved, confused, or mildly interested)
  - **14-18**: Positive outcome (message resonates and creates desired change)
  - **19-20**: Monumental success (extraordinary impact that exceeds all expectations)
- **Realistic Distribution**: Extreme outcomes (both positive and negative) are rare, while moderate results are most common
- **Unpredictability**: Same message and strategy can yield vastly different results across playthroughs
- **Strategic Risk**: Catastrophic failures can derail entire multi-figure strategies, while monumental successes can achieve objectives with fewer messages
- **Future Modifier Potential**: Framework allows for eventual complexity additions like character-based bonuses or situational modifiers

### AI System Architecture
- **Grand Objective Generator**: Creates overarching historical goals that require multi-figure coordination
- **Historical Figure AI**: Responds authentically to messages based on personality, era, and dice outcome
- **Timeline Evaluator AI**: Tracks how multiple conversations across time periods interact and influence each other
- **Outcome Judge AI**: Determines final success based on cumulative cross-timeline effects

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Multi-Timeline Strategy System
- **Grand Objectives**: Overarching goals that require coordination across multiple time periods
- **Figure Selection Strategy**: Players must consider which historical figures, when contacted together, could achieve the objective
- **Cross-Temporal Synergy**: Actions in one time period can amplify or diminish effects in another
- **Resource Allocation**: Deciding how to distribute 5 messages across chosen figures for maximum impact

### Multi-AI Collaboration System
- **Historical Figure AI**: Generates authentic responses based on personality, era, and dice roll outcome
- **Timeline Synthesis AI**: Weaves together consequences from multiple conversations across different time periods
- **Grand Objective AI**: Creates ambitious goals requiring multi-figure coordination (e.g., "Prevent the Dark Ages" or "Establish Global Democracy")
- **Narrative AI**: Describes how timeline changes from different eras interact and compound

### Probabilistic Outcome Mechanics
- **Dice Roll Integration**: Each message outcome determined by D20 roll, ensuring replayability
- **Outcome Interpretation**: AI interprets dice results contextually based on message content and historical figure
- **Narrative Consistency**: Even negative rolls create logical, story-driven consequences rather than arbitrary failures
- **Strategic Uncertainty**: Players must plan for multiple outcome possibilities, creating genuine strategic tension

### Example Multi-Figure Strategy
**Grand Objective**: "Accelerate Scientific Revolution by 200 years"
**Player Strategy**:
- Message Aristotle (350 BCE): Challenge his physics theories [Dice Roll: 17 - Positive]
- Message Al-Jazari (1200 CE): Inspire mechanical engineering focus [Dice Roll: 8 - Neutral]
- Message Copernicus (1540): Encourage bold publication [Dice Roll: 14 - Positive]
- Message Galileo (1610): Warn about Church persecution [Dice Roll: 2 - Catastrophic]
- Message Newton (1665): Suggest mathematical approach [Dice Roll: 19 - Monumental]

**Catastrophic Example**: Galileo, warned about persecution, becomes so paranoid he destroys all his research and flees Italy, setting back astronomy by decades and creating a chilling effect on scientific inquiry across Europe.

## Sample Experience: Preventing World War I

### AI-Generated Grand Objective
*"Prevent the outbreak of World War I through strategic interventions across multiple time periods and key figures."*

### Player's Multi-Figure Strategy
The player decides to contact 5 different historical figures with 1 message each:

**Message 1 to Otto von Bismarck (1878)**
*"Your alliance system will doom Europe to unprecedented war. Consider economic unity over military pacts."*
**Dice Roll**: 12 (Positive) - Bismarck begins drafting economic cooperation treaties instead of military alliances

**Timeline Update**: *"The Triple Alliance shifts toward trade agreements. European nations begin viewing economic cooperation as preferable to military deterrence."*

**Message 2 to Archduke Franz Ferdinand (1913)**
*"Your future assassination sparks global war. Increase your security and avoid Sarajevo on June 28, 1914."*
**Dice Roll**: 1 (Catastrophic Disaster) - Franz Ferdinand becomes so paranoid about assassination attempts that he advocates for preemptive military action against Serbia

**Timeline Update**: *"Franz Ferdinand's newfound paranoia leads him to push Austria-Hungary toward immediate military intervention in Serbian affairs. His influence accelerates the very conflict the message intended to prevent."*

**Message 3 to Kaiser Wilhelm II (1913)**
*"Your cousin George and cousin Nicholas seek peace. Family bonds are stronger than empire. Choose cooperation."*
**Dice Roll**: 18 (Positive) - Wilhelm begins diplomatic outreach to his royal cousins

**Timeline Update**: *"Despite Franz Ferdinand's hawkish turn, Kaiser Wilhelm II initiates unprecedented diplomatic correspondence with King George V and Tsar Nicholas II, seeking to defuse growing tensions through family bonds."*

**Message 4 to Vladimir Lenin (1916)**
*"Revolution now will save Russia from endless war. Strike while the army weakens."*
**Dice Roll**: 12 (Neutral) - Lenin considers the advice but remains cautious about timing

**Timeline Update**: *"Lenin takes note of the mysterious counsel but continues his calculated approach to revolution, neither accelerating nor abandoning his plans."*

**Message 5 to Woodrow Wilson (1917)**
*"America's entry into European war creates precedent for endless global conflict. Choose isolation and prosperity."*
**Dice Roll**: 20 (Monumental Success) - Wilson becomes a passionate advocate for permanent American neutrality

### Final Outcome Assessment
**AI Evaluation**: *"The catastrophic backfire with Franz Ferdinand nearly doomed the mission, as his paranoia actually accelerated tensions toward war. However, Wilson's monumental conversion to absolute neutrality, combined with Wilhelm II's family diplomacy, created enough counterbalancing forces to prevent full-scale global conflict. The result: a limited Austro-Serbian war that burns out quickly due to lack of broader alliance participation. World War I is averted, but at the cost of increased Austro-Hungarian oppression in the Balkans."*

**Success Level**: Narrow Victory - Objective achieved through dramatic reversals and near-failure
