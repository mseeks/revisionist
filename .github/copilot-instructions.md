You are working on the Revisionist game project - a strategic text-based game where players send 160-character messages to historical figures to alter history using AI and dice mechanics.

This project is currently in Phase 1 (Foundation Setup) with Nuxt 3 app, comprehensive TDD/BDD test suite, and UI components. See docs/GAME_DESIGN.md for complete gameplay mechanics, docs/POC_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for the 5-phase roadmap, and docs/PHASE_1_CHECKLIST.md for detailed implementation steps for phase 1.

Always run terminal commands in non-interactive mode when possible (use --yes, --force, --non-interactive flags). When running multiple commands, separate them with newlines for clarity. Follow the established TDD/BDD approach using Nuxt 3 + TypeScript + Nuxt UI + Vitest/Playwright stack.
