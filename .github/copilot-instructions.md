You are working on the Revisionist game project - a strategic text-based game where players send 160-character messages to historical figures to alter history using AI and dice mechanics.

This project is currently in Phase 2 (Core Game State) with Nuxt 3 app, comprehensive TDD/BDD test suite, and UI components. Phase 1 is complete with full UI layout. See docs/GAME_DESIGN.md for complete gameplay mechanics, docs/POC_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for the 5-phase roadmap, docs/PHASE_1_CHECKLIST.md (completed), and docs/PHASE_2_CHECKLIST.md for detailed implementation steps for phase 2.

Always run terminal commands in non-interactive mode when possible (use --yes, --force, --non-interactive flags). When running multiple commands, separate them with newlines for clarity. Follow the established TDD/BDD approach using Nuxt 3 + TypeScript + Nuxt UI + Pinia + Vitest/Playwright stack.
